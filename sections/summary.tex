AskJamie is Singapore's virtual assistant to provide information to end users directly through chatbots. Currently the Natural Language Processing (NLP) engine in AskJamie is supported by a third party vendor FlexAnswer. With latest advancements in NLP and chatbot technologies, my team at Goverment Technology Agency (GovTech) is looking into better NLP engine alternatives. As AskJamie's NLP engine is migrated, one of the sub-objectives is to provide a platform for users to clean the chatbot's training dataset. The idea came about after observing end users adding poor training data into the chatbot dataset that resulted in poor performances in the chatbot. Therefore, the platform, I am tasked with, aims to provide end users an overview of the chatbot dataset and identify areas of improvement in the knowledge base. The platform will also help users to migrate data from one vendor to another and support regression testing to ensure the chatbot produces the correct response after updates are made to the training dataset. \\
